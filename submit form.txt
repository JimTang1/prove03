4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Everything is working.
This week just has a lot of information need to understand. I like it but spend much longer time than I thought. It is hard is because I don't really know how callback functions work. I think if we do have some call-back function exercise before this project. many things will be reasonable and easiler.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
How MVC work and how it becomes much more organized and professional. For some reason, I feel node.js is a full-stack developer language instead of a backend language.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
No. this week, I spend a lot of time studying how MVC work. I like it a lot even I spend a lot of time lol.
