Everything is working.
This week just has a lot of information need to understand. I like it but spend much longer time than I thought. It is hard is because I don't really know how callback functions work. I think if we do have some call-back function exercise before this project. many things will be reasonable and easiler.

How MVC work and how it becomes much more organized and professional. For some reason, I feel node.js is a full-stack developer language instead of a backend language.

No. this week, I spend a lot of time studying how MVC work. I like it a lot even I spend a lot of time lol.
